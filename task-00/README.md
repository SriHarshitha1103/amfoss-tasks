Install Ubuntu 20.04 [Desktop]

This was hard for me...😥because when I thought of dual booting..there was a warning that data will be erased..and when I thought of first transferring all data into pen drive and then dual boot it..my sister forbade it😐🙄(BTW I'm using my sister's laptop so she has all her important data in my laptop😅). So then I downloaded it on virtual box successfully and I now use it on virtual box without causing any threat of erasing my sister's data...phew😁😁
